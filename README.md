## 🌟 Introduction

Welcome to the **Detection of Large-Language Model (LLM) Generated Text** project! This project aims to distinguish between human-generated and LLM-generated text, addressing concerns related to misinformation, plagiarism, and ethics. With the rise of LLM models like GPT-4, it has become crucial to develop robust detection mechanisms to ensure the integrity and reliability of text-based communication.

## 📚 Project Overview

### 🔍 Need for Detection of LLM Generated Text
The need for detecting LLM-generated text arises from several factors:
- **Misinformation Control:** 🚫 LLMs can spread false information rapidly. Detection helps in identifying and mitigating the impact of misinformation.
- **Plagiarism Prevention:** 📝 Identifying LLM-generated content assists in preventing academic and content plagiarism, maintaining integrity in research and publications.
- **Ethical Considerations:** ⚖️ Understanding the origin of text content is crucial for maintaining ethical standards, especially in sensitive areas like news reporting and legal documentation.
- **Trust and Transparency:** 🔍 Detection fosters trust by ensuring transparency about the source of text content, enhancing credibility in communication channels.

### ⚙️ Methodology
In this project, we leverage natural language processing (NLP) techniques to build an effective detection system. The process includes:
1. **Data Collection:** Gathering a diverse dataset of human and LLM-generated texts.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Extracting relevant features that can distinguish between human and LLM-generated texts.
3. **Model Selection:** Choosing appropriate machine learning models for classification.
4. **Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## 🚀 Training the Model Locally

To train the model locally, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone -b main https://github.com/Harshithvarma007/LLM_Text_Detection.git
cd LLM_Text_Detection
```

### Step 2: Set Up Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies

```sh
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


This script will train the detection model using the configured dataset and save the trained model weights.

### Step 3: Run the Application

Start the Streamlit app to interact with the trained model:

```sh
streamlit run app.py
```

### Step 4: Navigate the App

Once the Streamlit app is running, open your web browser and visit [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501). Navigate within the app to find the "Train Model" button to initiate training if it's not already trained using `train.py`.
