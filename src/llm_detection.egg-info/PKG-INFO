# LLM Text Detection
 
## Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to detect essays written by students versus those generated by large language models (LLMs). The goal is to enhance transparency and research in AI detection techniques applicable in real-world scenarios.


## Description
The competition dataset contains a mix of student-written essays and LLM-generated essays. The challenge is to build a model that accurately identifies the origin of each essay. This project addresses concerns about the impact of LLMs on educational processes, particularly in detecting potential plagiarism and maintaining educational standards.

## Acknowledgments
We extend our thanks to Vanderbilt University, The Learning Agency Lab, and supporters like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Schmidt Futures, and Chan Zuckerberg Initiative for their invaluable contributions to this project.

## Evaluation
Submissions are evaluated based on the area under the ROC curve between predicted probabilities and observed targets.
